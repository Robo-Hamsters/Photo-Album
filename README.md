## Some help with GitHub and InteliJ

### Step 1: Fork this repository

+ The objective here is to make a copy of this project and place it in your account.
+ A repository (repo) is how a project is called on GitHub and a fork is a copy of it.
+ Make sure you are on the [main page] (https://github.com/thomaSzegoS/Photo-Album-Project) of this repo.
<ul><li>Click on the _'Fork'_ Button</li></ul>

You now have a complete copy of the project in your own account!

### Step 2: Clone the repository

+ Now we want to make a local copy of the project. That is a copy saved on your own machine.
+ Open InteliJ.

<ul><li>Click on _'Check out from Version Control'_ then _'GitHub'_</li></ul>

<br>
<ul><li>Select _Auth Type: 'password'_ and login to your GitHub account.</li></ul>

<br>
<ul><li>Select your forked _Git Repository URL_ and choose the _Parent Directory_ where you want to save your project.</li></ul>

<br>

<ul><li>Click _Clone_</li></ul>

Now you have a local copy of the project!

### Step 3: Create a new branch

+ A branch is a way to keep your changes separate from the main part of the project called `Master`. For example if things go wrong and you are not happy with your changes you can simply delete the branch and the main project won't be affected.

<ul><li>Click on _Git: master_ and select _New Branch_</li></ul>

<br>
<ul><li>This Branch is a local branch and its only visible by your computer.</li></ul>
![preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomaSzegoS/Photo-Album-Project/master/Images/MD5.jpg)
<br>
<ul><li>Add a branch name and click _OK_ </li></ul>

<br>

### Step 4: Commit your changes

+ This roughly means "confirm the changes"

<ul><li>Click on _Commit..._ ( VCS -> Commit )</li></ul>
![preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomaSzegoS/Photo-Album-Project/master/Images/MD7.jpg)
<br>
<ul><li>Select your files you want to commit and click _Commit and Push..._</li></ul>

### Step 5: Create a Pull Request

+ Now it's time to send your changes to the main project to be merged with it.
+ This is called a Pull Request because you are asking the original project maintainer to "pull" your changes into their project.

<ul><li>Click on _Create Pull Request_ ( VCS -> Git -> Create Pull Request )</li></ul>
![preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomaSzegoS/Photo-Album-Project/master/Images/MD10.jpg)
<br>
<ul><li>Select _Base branch: 'master'_ give a _Title_ and add a small description about your changes.</li></ul>
